# challenge3final

## Description

This is the final version of challenge 3. It includes a javascript to generate a new password given specific criterias when prompted. The user will first be prompted to decide how long they'd like their password to be between 8 and 128 characters in length. From there, they're prompted to select whether or not they wish to include lowercase, uppoercase, numeric, and special characters. Once the script is ran, a new password with the selected criteria is generated.
